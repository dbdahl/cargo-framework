Rscript -e "cargo::install(TRUE)"

The cargo package would like to download Rust from https://rustup.rs/ (an
official website of the Rust project) and then install Rust into the directory:
    /home/dahl/.cache/R/cargo
That directory will then be used to keep the Rust installation up-to-date. It
will also be used to: 1. cache shared libraries for R packages based on Rust
and 2. enable cached compilation for the cargo::rust_fn function. The cargo
package purges unused cache items every 91 days, but you can change the
frequency by modifying the last line of the "last-purge" file in that
directory. You can revoke permission at any time by deleting that directory.

Agreement accepted due to 'force=TRUE'.
