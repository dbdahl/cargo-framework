Description: A framework is provided to develop R packages using 'Rust' <https://www.rust-lang.org/> with
 minimal overhead, and more wrappers are easily added. Help is provided to use 'Cargo' <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/> in a manner
 consistent with CRAN policies. 'Rust' code can also be embedded directly in an R script. The package is not official, affiliated with,
 nor endorsed by the Rust project.
