This R package relies on Cargo, the Rust package manager. Cargo can be provided in a number of way.
Any of the following methods should work:

1. Install the "cargo" package on CRAN and run "cargo::install()".  This will install Cargo in
   the directory given by "tools::R_user_dir('cargo', 'cache')".

OR

2. Install from a package manager and let it by found from the $PATH environment variable, e.g.:

   Debian:  sudo apt install cargo
   Ubuntu:  sudo apt install cargo
   Fedora:  sudo dnf install cargo
   MacOS:   brew install rust

OR

3. Install from https://rustup.rs, an official Rust website, e.g.:

   Linux / MacOS:
     * Run: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh --no-modify-path -y

   Windows:
     * Download rustup-init.exe from https://rustup.rs
     * Open the terminal in the directory in which rustup-init.exe was downloaded
     * Run: .\rustup-init.exe --no-modify-path -y --default-host x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

   If you do not mind having the script modify your PATH environment variable, remove the
   "--no-modify-path" argument.  This is not necessarily, however, as the R package should
   still be able to find the "cargo" executable in the $HOME/.cargo directory.
