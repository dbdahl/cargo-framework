This package is based on Rust source code compiled by Cargo, the Rust package
manager. Cargo can be: 1. provided by the operating system package manager, 2.
obtained from the Rust project at https://rustup.rs, or 3. provided by running
cargo::install() in an interactive R session. Note that cargo::install() is
preferred because the Cargo installation is automatically updated as needed.

If a suitable version of Cargo is not available when installing the source
package (e.g., a particular CRAN build server is missing Cargo), the Rust
source code is embedded in the binary package and parts of some examples may be
wrapped in \dontrun because they will not work "out-of-the-box". Instead, the
end-user of the binary package can provide Cargo and the examples will indeed
work. Again, the easiest way to provide Cargo is to run cargo::install() in an
interactive session.
