This package is based on Rust source code compiled by Cargo, the Rust package
manager. Cargo can be: 1. provided by the operating system package manager, 2.
obtained from the Rust project at https://rustup.rs, or 3. provided by running
cargo::install() in an interactive R session. Note that cargo::install() is
preferred because the Cargo installation is automatically updated as needed.
