0.2.5 (2022-06-18)
  * Better Makevars and Makevars.win.
  * Minor bug fixes.
  * Replaced "&mut pc" with "pc".

0.2.3 (2022-04-26)
  * Added functionality for the following:  The original approach downloaded
    precompiled static libraries when compiling source packages if a sufficient
    version of the Rust toolchain could not be found. With a recent revision to
    CRAN policies, however, this approach is no longer allowed.  As such, if a
    sufficient version cannot be found when compiling the source package, our Cargo
    Framework embeds the Rust source code in the resulting binary package. The
    .onLoad and .onAttach functions of the package can then compile the Rust code
    if Cargo is available on the end user's machine, or ask the end user to allow
    it to install Cargo and then compile the Rust code.

0.1.38 (2021-08-21)
  * Added setup_rust function to aid in installing the Rust toolchain and
    targets needed for compiling static libraries for CRAN build machines.
  * Added cross_compile function to compile static libraries for all targets
    used by CRAN build machines.
  * Added api_documentation function to launch web browser to show the API
    for the cargo framework.

0.1.37 (2021-08-14)
  * Expanded the functionality of the 'cargo' framework for Rust-based package
    development, beyond its foundation in release 0.1.30.
  * Added the rust_fn function to embed Rust code directly in an R script.

0.1.30 (2021-05-24)
  * Added functionality make a complete package stub, ready for Rust
    development.  See the "new_package" function, or, in RStudio, select the
    following menu sequence: "File" -> "New Project..." -> "New Directory" ->
    "R Package Using Rust and the 'cargo' Framework".
  * Added "register_calls" function to automatically generate Rust code to register
    Rust functions used in .Call() function calls. Rerun this function when usage of
    .Call() changes.

0.1.29 (2021-03-29)
  * Explicitly search for rustc and set the RUSTC environment variable.
  * Fixed an ERROR on Solaris and NOTEs on development version of R.

0.1.28 (2021-03-16)
  * Improved run() function to return a logical indicating success, avoid
    warnings and errors, and limit the number of parallel jobs to two (as per
    CRAN policy).
  * Added experimental support for "aarch64-apple-darwin" target.
  * The is_available() function is scheduled for removal.
  * The install() function is not exported and may be removed.

0.1.19 (2021-03-08)
  * Fixed CRAN concern about large download and file cache.

0.1.10 (2021-03-03)
  * First version on CRAN.
